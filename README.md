Amphibians app
==================================

Code for Android Basics with Compose Practice Set.

Pre-requisites
--------------

You need to know:
- How to create Composable functions.
- How to use architecture components including ViewModel.
- How to use [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to retrieve data from the internet.
- How to use [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) to load images.

Getting Started
---------------

1. [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html), if you don't already
   have it.
2. Download the app.
3. Import the app into Android Studio.
4. Build and run the app.

## My Accessibility Contributions

I prioritized accessibility features to ensure that the app is usable by a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. Here are the specific accessibility enhancements I implemented:

- **Bold Text**: Incorporated bold text where appropriate to improve readability for users with visual impairments.

- **Color Contrast**: Ensured that there is sufficient color contrast between text and background throughout the app. By enhancing color contrast, I aimed to improve readability for users with low vision or color vision deficiencies. This helps prevent text from blending into the background and enhances overall legibility.

- **Bigger Text**: Increased the text size in certain areas of the app to benefit users with visual impairments or those who prefer larger text for readability.

 ## My UI Design Contributions

I focused on enhancing the user experience (UX) design to create a more engaging and visually appealing app. Here are the specific UX design enhancements I implemented:

- **Shadows**: Incorporated subtle shadows to card elements throughout the app to create depth and improve visual hierarchy. The addition of shadows helps to differentiate card components from the background and provides a more immersive user experience.

- **Rounded Corners**: Updated the design by adding more rounded corners to card elements throughout the app. This softens the overall aesthetic, creates a more modern look, and contributes to a friendlier user interface. The increased roundness of the corners also enhances visual consistency and cohesion across the app's design.

- **Animation**: As part of enhancing the user experience, I implemented animations to improve the visual appeal and interactivity of the app. One notable animation I added was a spring animation applied to the columns within the app's layout. This spring animation creates a lively and dynamic effect, adding a sense of fluidity and responsiveness to the user interface.

 ## My Testing Contributions

I conducted thorough testing to verify the functionality and reliability of the app. Here are the specific testing contributions I made:

- **Repository Testing**: Tested the repository layer to verify that data is retrieved from the API service correctly and passed to the ViewModel.

- **ViewModel Testing**: Conducted tests to ensure that the ViewModel correctly processes and exposes data to the UI layer.
